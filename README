django-billing is a simple, generic, plans, pricing and recurring billing billing app to monitor and enforce quotas, pre-paid and usage-based features.

There are four steps needed to get started:

1. Install django-billing
2. Plug in a billing processor
3. Define your products
4. Create your templates


Installation
------------

1. pip install django-billing
2. add `billing` to your list of installed apps


Billing Processors
------------------

While django-billing collects all the information needed to bill
customers, it doesn't take a stance on how payments should be collected. django-billing delegates responsibility for actually charging a customer
to a billing processor.




Defining Products
-----------------

Products are what your customers subscribe to, and are defined as
classes (in a similar manner to Django models).

A Product class is used for three puposes:

1. to check the usage of a given feature
2. to enforce limits upon the usage of features
3. to calculate information for invoices

For example, in the example project shipped with django-billing,
there is a base definition 

They are defined as a collection of features (each of which is
composed of a value and a provisioning scheme) along with
certain details about usage limits and pricing.

django-billing relies on python-pricing to set up the
pricing model.

products should be defined in a `products.py` file

An example of defining products can be seen in
example_saas_project/core/products.py

Since products are often created by class hierarchies, only those products
which you wish to be subscribable should be imported into a billing.py

Point to this billing definitions module with ``BILLING_DEFINITIONS``
in settings.py. In the example, the billing definitions are
in example_saas_project/core/billing.py, so in settings.py, we've added::

    BILLING_DEFINITIONS = 'example_saas_project.core.billing'


Templates
---------

You need to define a number of templates. There are examples in
example_saas_project/core/templates/billing
